## Medium-Term 

**Projects which were completed over multiple weeks, requiring multiple iterations and feedback sessions.**

### 1. Client: Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA)

- **Short Description**: Tim was tasked with providing training to employees (variety of analysts and officials) at the revenue authority on measuring, reporting, and evaluating tax expenditure.
- **Solution**: Though much of the technical training was already in existence from prior trainings for similar client needs, we needed to incorporate relevant and recent case studies highlighting best practices in calculating and reporting tax expenditure. In parallel, we wanted to provide technical advisory on how to create a microsimulation which could assess the impact of changes in the baseline PIT/CIT rate on the tax base/tax revenue.
- **I Delivered**:
  - A comprehensive assessment of tax expenditure reporting and methodology for 3 countries at different stages of fiscal transparency
  - An overview of best practices in tax expenditure reporting and evaluation (as outlined by the IMF)
  - Deliverables were included in the final training, and later used for re-structuring tax expenditure reporting 
  - Created preliminary .do file for Stata simulation using taxpayer data from ZRA
 
### 2. Client: USAID, El Salvador

- **Short Description**: The client wanted a cost-benefit analysis of AEO certification, which would ultimately help in assessing whether such a process would be beneficial for the country or how it can be adjusted to provide increased benefit for stakeholders.
- **Solution**: Considering there was little data or study modeling the broader gains and losses from receiving AEO certification/status, we concluded that for this assignment it would be beneficial to **run a localized survey of firms**, asking them about specific aspects of costs/savings with respect to AEO designation. This **would require looking into different aspects of customs, supply chain, cargo management, and firm-level administration that would be correlated with having an AEO designation.**
- **I Delivered**:
  - A comprehensive overview of potential costs and potential savings/revenue gains from AEO designation, specifying data needed and estimation methods for each
  - Assessed the landscape of AEO research and country-level implementation information currently available
  - Contributed to the development of survey distributed to firms, with analysis against small response sample received

## Long-Term 

**On-going projects which involved a variety of deliverables, skills, and longer build times.**

### 1. Client: Department of Treasury, PNG

- **Short Description**: In providing technical advisory to PNG on matters related to public financial management, we are responsible for maintaining an internal tracking system – the Revenue Tracking Table – for week-to-week cashflows into the public account (weekly revenue from customs) and weekly tax revenues received by the revenue commission. This table must eventually be used and maintained within the PNG treasury, opposed to external monitoring.
- **Solution**: In order to hand off this tool to an employee within the PNG treasury, we needed to **ensure that all tables had consistent formulas and easy readability**. We needed to clean the Revenue Tracking Table, and the **ensure that it could be maintained easily by someone outside of our team**. 
- **I Delivered**:
  - A cleaned version of the Revenue Tracking Table, with help from Tim in understanding the function of existing formulas and line items
  - A short methodology on maintaining the Revenue Tracking Table, which could be easily understood by anyone looking at the workbook for the first time

### 2. Client: Department of Treasury, PNG

- **Short Description**: Cashflow highlights circulated at the end of each week to members of PNG treasury and relevant technical advisors outline the public account balance as of the week-start, inflows predicted for the week, outflows for the week prior, and predicted outflows for the current week. However, there is currently no insight into how predicted flows match to actual flows.
- **Solution**: During my internship, I was **responsible for extracting and organizing data from these cashflow briefs**. Once this data was in a flexible format (.xlsx), we could **format the data in a way that was easy to analyze**. We were then able to perform high-level analysis to determine how predicted outflows compared against actual outflows. This would **ultimately help in advising our client on how to better monitor cashflow and identify issues early enough to troubleshoot prediction methods.**
- **I Delivered**:
  - A workbook of organized data, extracted from cashflow highlights, transfer briefs, and revenue reports
  - Calculated basic differences in projected versus actual data in weekly briefs
  - Shadowed Tim in creating visualizations for data analysis 

### 3. Client: Department of Treasury, PNG

- **Short Description**: The client wanted a comprehensive scan of potential climate finance facilities available to PNG, their current activities as well as ways to further engage with organizations providing green finance services.
- **Solution**: Considering the recent interest in green finance, the **area is still difficult to navigate, with a lot of information and services tied to climate action** which may or may not constitute green finance/green lending. Our task was to **develop a scan of intergovernmental organizations, multilateral banks, funds, and development banks which had green finance facilities**. Further, we looked into how exactly PNG could engage further with these organizations, and **highlighted any barriers to access PNG currently faces**. 
- **I Delivered**:
  - A beta scan of funds, intergovernmental agencies, and development banks which operate in this space
  - Contributed to the final document using my research and insights
  - Helped in developing client-ready documentation and advisory on green finance facilities for PNG, positioning my research in a way that would add most value to the client
