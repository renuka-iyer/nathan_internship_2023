## Medium Term 

**Projects which were completed over multiple weeks, requiring multiple iterations and feedback sessions.**

### 1. Client: Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA)

- **Short Description**: Tim was tasked with providing training to employees (variety of analysts and officials) at the revenue authority on measuring, reporting, and evaluating tax expenditure.
- **Solution**: Though much of the technical training was already in existence from prior trainings for similar client needs, we needed to incorporate relevant and recent case studies highlighting best practices in calculating and reporting tax expenditure. In parallel, we wanted to provide technical advisory on how to create a microsimulation which could assess the impact of changes in the baseline PIT/CIT rate on the tax base/tax revenue.
- **I Delivered**:
  - A comprehensive assessment of tax expenditure reporting and methodology for 3 countries at different stages of fiscal transparency
  - An overview of best practices in tax expenditure reporting and evaluation (as outlined by the IMF)
  - Deliverables were included in the final training, and later used for re-structuring tax expenditure reporting 
  - Created preliminary .do file for Stata simulation using taxpayer data from ZRA
 
### 1. Client: USAID, El Salvador

- **Short Description**: The client wanted a cost-benefit analysis of AEO certification, which would ultimately help in assessing whether such a process would be beneficial for the country or how it can be adjusted to provide increased benefit for stakeholders.
- **Solution**: Considering there was little data or study modeling the broader gains and losses from receiving AEO certification/status, we concluded that for this assignment it would be beneficial to **run a localized survey of firms**, asking them about specific aspects of costs/savings with respect to AEO designation. This **would require looking into different aspects of customs, supply chain, cargo management, and firm-level administration that would be correlated with having an AEO designation.**
- **I Delivered**:
  - A comprehensive overview of potential costs and potential savings/revenue gains from AEO designation, specifying data needed and estimation methods for each
  - Assessed the landscape of AEO research and country-level implementation information currently available
  - Contributed to the development of survey distributed to firms, with analysis against small response sample received
